🏦 Credit Score Classification — Machine Learning Project

This project predicts whether a customer’s credit score is Good, Standard, or Poor based on their financial behavior and credit history. The goal was simple: build a reliable end-to-end ML pipeline that feels production-ready, not just “classroom ready”.

🚀 What This Project Is About

Banks and financial institutions need to assess how risky a person is before giving loans or credit cards. Instead of manually analyzing dozens of features, this model helps automate decision-making by using data like:

Outstanding debt

Interest rate

Delayed payments

Credit mix

Number of credit inquiries

& many more financial indicators

🧠 What The Model Does

Cleans messy real-world credit data

Converts mixed types & handles missing values

Encodes categorical values properly

Trains a machine learning model

Tunes it using GridSearchCV

Evaluates model performance

Finds the most important features driving credit score decisions

🏗️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-Learn

Random Forest

GridSearchCV

SMOTE (optional for imbalance handling)

📊 Model Performance

Final model accuracy achieved:
≈ 66%+ accuracy

Not perfect (credit data is tough!), but strong enough to extract meaningful insights and build upon.

⭐ Key Feature Importance Insights

Some features turned out to be extremely powerful in predicting credit score:

Outstanding Debt (strongest impact)

Interest Rate

Credit Mix

Payment Delays

Credit Inquiries

Number of Credit Cards

Minimum Payment Behavior

Business takeaway:

Credit score is strongly influenced by repayment discipline, outstanding liabilities, and financial responsibility, not just income levels.
